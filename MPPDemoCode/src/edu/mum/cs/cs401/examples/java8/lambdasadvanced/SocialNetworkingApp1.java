/**
 * This approach can potentially make your application brittle, which is the likelihood of an application not working because of the introduction of updates

 * change the structure of the Person class such that it contains different member variables; 
 * perhaps the class records and measures ages with a different data type or algorithm. 
 * 
 * You would have to rewrite a lot of your API to accommodate this change. In addition, this approach is unnecessarily restrictive; 
 * what if you wanted to print members younger than a certain age, for example?
